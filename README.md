# callinfo-class
php class to consume calllook.info json output

I wrote this for an ARES personnel system that I've been writing. 
Sometime Net Control enters a Call Sign that my wordpress plug-in database doesn't already have.
This function uses callook.info to get the unknown call information and verify the QSO before it is entered into the database.
It also allows me to correct my entries before a typo gets entered into the DB. 
I'm sure there are wizards that could add great improvements to this but for now it works
